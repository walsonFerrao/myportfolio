# Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website built with React, styled components, and Framer Motion.


## Tools and technologies used

## Get started

Open up your command line and clone this repo:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone <repo link>

# Go into the repository
$ cd portfolio-website

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin

# If you want, you can add a new remote repository
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<your-repo-name>.git

Then you can install the project dependencies using npm:
